# Weather Alert System

This Python script uses WeatherAPI to send daily weather alerts via Telegram. It checks for rain, strong winds, heat (>85°F), and cold (<60°F) and sends notifications accordingly.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your `.env` file with your API keys for WeatherAPI and Telegram.
3. Add a cron job to run the script daily.
